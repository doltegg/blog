花了點心力看了20年前的電影《駭客任務》。

The matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. But when you’re inside, look around, what do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are a part of that system, and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inert so hopelessly dependent on the system that they will fight to protect it.

You take the blue pill, the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.

雖然是虛擬去中心化的世界，<br>
可是我還是很在意有「先知」的存在呀，<br>
怎麼辦？
